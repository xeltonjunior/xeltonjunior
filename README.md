Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif) My name is Elton Júnior
====================================================================================================================================

Computer Engineer, Data Engineer & Developer
--------------------------------------------

I hold a degree in Computer Engineering and work as a Software Developer and Automation and Data Processing Specialist, with solid experience in full-stack application development using TypeScript (front-end and back-end), integration with PostgreSQL and BigQuery, and building ETL pipelines and data processing in Python. My expertise is focused on data analysis, process automation, and operational reliability.

I worked as a Network & Infrastructure Software Engineer at Tecnospeed – Wifire, focusing on developing captive portal and hotspot platforms integrated with Wi-Fi controllers and corporate firewalls. In addition to configuring the infrastructure, I was involved in the development of the user authentication system, session control, reports, and network device integrations, always ensuring security, interoperability, and observability.

At SEG Tecnologia, I served as an Infrastructure & VoIP Systems Engineer, responsible for designing and automating telecommunications infrastructure for clients, with a focus on IPBX servers based on Asterisk. I also led topology analysis, technical requirement definition, and integration between web systems (PHP) and voice and data infrastructure, with automated monitoring using Grafana and Zabbix.

I began my career at Internews Sistemas as an intern and was promoted to Quality Assurance Analyst (QA) in 2018, where I created and structured the company’s QA department. I defined processes, methodologies, and quality standards and worked through the validation and approval cycles of systems developed in Delphi and Java, using SQL, Firebird, and MySQL to ensure data traceability and auditing.

Throughout my career, I have developed a multidisciplinary profile that integrates software engineering, infrastructure, automation, data, and quality, with a focus on reliability, scalability, and operational excellence.
